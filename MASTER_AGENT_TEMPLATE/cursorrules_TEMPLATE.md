# AI Agent Project Entry Point

Before performing ANY action in this project, you MUST read the following files to re-align your context:

1.  **Project Brain**: [.agent/docs/project_context.md](file:///app/.agent/docs/project_context.md) - Infrastructure, paths, and mission.
2.  **Universal Rules**: [.agent/rules/behavior.md](file:///app/.agent/rules/behavior.md) - Critical constraints and forbidden actions.

Use these files as your one and only Source of Truth for this project environment.
